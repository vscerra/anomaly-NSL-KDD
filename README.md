# 🔐 Anomaly Detection on the NSL-KDD Dataset

A hands-on exploration of classical and deep learning techniques for identifying network intrusions.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project applies and compares multiple anomaly detection techniques on the NSL-KDD dataset — a benchmark dataset for network intrusion detection. It includes exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, classical machine learning models, and deep learning architectures. The project also serves as a reusable template for structuring future anomaly detection work.

Along the way, I’m building personal fluency with both the conceptual underpinnings and practical implementations of anomaly detection — making this a dual-purpose learning and portfolio project.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Name**: NSL-KDD (derived from KDD’99)
- **Source**: [UNB CIC Repository](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html)
- **Size**: ~125,000 rows, 41 features
- **Task**: Binary anomaly detection (normal vs. attack) with multiclass subtype labels
- **Why it’s interesting**: NSL-KDD is widely used for network intrusion detection benchmarking and includes a range of attack types under realistic conditions of class imbalance.
